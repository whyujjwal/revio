# Skills Registry

This file is the **central index** of all available skills in this monorepo.
AI agents should read this file to discover what skills exist, what they do,
and when to use them. Each skill is a self-contained directory under `/skills/`.

---

## How Skills Work

Each skill directory contains:
- `manifest.json` — Machine-readable metadata (trigger conditions, commands, inputs/outputs)
- `README.md` — Human/agent-readable explanation of when and how to use the skill
- `run.sh` — Executable entry point (always run from repo root)

Agents should:
1. Read this registry to find relevant skills for their current task.
2. Read the skill's `manifest.json` to understand inputs, outputs, and commands.
3. Execute via `bash skills/<skill-name>/run.sh [args]` from the repo root.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Trigger | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `init` | First clone of template | Initialize template: rename project name, scope, descriptions, DB names across entire repo |
| `finish` | **Every task completion** | Lint → test → commit → push. The mandatory last step. Never skip. |
| `type-sync` | Pydantic model changed | Regenerates OpenAPI spec → TypeScript types → validates frontend build |
| `db-migrate` | SQLAlchemy model changed | Creates and applies Alembic migration |
| `openapi-gen` | Any schema change | Exports OpenAPI JSON from FastAPI app |
| `lint-fix` | Before commit / on demand | Runs linters and auto-fixes across the monorepo |
| `test-run` | After code changes | Runs test suites for affected packages |
| `dependency-add` | Need to add a package | Adds dependency using correct package manager (pnpm or uv) |
| `memory` | Any time | Save important context or recall past decisions via local vector DB |
| `docker` | On demand | Manage full stack (API + PostgreSQL) via Docker Compose |
| `checkpoint` | At logical milestones | Creates a versioned Entire snapshot of codebase + agent context |
| `prd-workflow` | Starting a new feature | Ryan Carson's 3-step workflow: PRD → task list → one-task-at-a-time execution |
| `deploy` | Emergency manual deploy | Build Docker image and deploy API or Web to Google Cloud Run via gcloud |

## Skill Trigger Rules

Agents MUST check these trigger conditions after making changes:

0. **Task complete** → Run `finish "<conventional commit message>"` — always, no exceptions
1. **Modified a file in `apps/api/app/schemas/`** → Run `type-sync`
2. **Modified a file in `apps/api/app/models/`** → Run `db-migrate`
3. **Modified any Python or TypeScript file** → Run `lint-fix`
4. **Finished a feature or fix** → Run `test-run`
5. **Need a new library** → Run `dependency-add` (never run npm/pip directly)
6. **Completed a logical milestone** → Run `checkpoint` to version agent context
7. **Want to remember a decision, pattern, or preference** → Run `memory save`
8. **Need past context before starting a task** → Run `memory recall`
9. **Need to start or manage the local stack** → Run `docker up|down|migrate`
10. **Starting work on a new feature** → Run `prd-workflow init` and follow the 3-step rule-file workflow
11. **Need to deploy manually outside CI/CD** → Run `deploy api|web` (requires gcloud auth; prefer pushing to `main`)
12. **Just cloned this template** → Run `init` to customize the project name, scope, and identity

## PRD Workflow (Rule Files)

The `prd-workflow` skill orchestrates three AI rule files that enforce structured feature development:

| Rule File | When to Use | Output |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `rules/generate_prd.md` | Beginning of a feature | `tasks/PRD.md` |
| `rules/generate_tasks.md` | After PRD is written | `tasks/TASKS.md` |
| `rules/task_list_management.md` | During implementation | Updated `tasks/TASKS.md` |

**In your agent**, reference rule files like this:
```
@rules/generate_prd.md I want to build: <describe feature>
@rules/generate_tasks.md @tasks/PRD.md
@rules/task_list_management.md @tasks/TASKS.md
```

## AI Infrastructure

### Long-Term Memory (ChromaDB)
Agents can store and retrieve semantic memories via the `memory` skill, the `/memory/add` and
`/memory/search` API endpoints, or directly through `app.services.memory.MemoryService`.
ChromaDB runs locally — no external API, no account required. Data persists in `.data/chromadb/`.
Use tags to namespace memories per agent or user.

```bash
# Save
bash skills/memory/run.sh save "content" "tag1,tag2"
# Recall
bash skills/memory/run.sh recall "query" "tag"
# List
bash skills/memory/run.sh list "tag"
```

### Context Versioning (Entire CLI)
Entire captures agent reasoning at every git commit via hooks in `.claude/settings.json`.
- Strategy: `manual-commit` — checkpoints happen on git commits
- Browse history: `entire log`
- Compare checkpoints: `entire diff <id>`
- Use the `checkpoint` skill at logical milestones
